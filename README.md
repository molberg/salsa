# salsa
Little pieces of code to show how SALSA data can be handled using R or Python.

The repository contains the following files:

* FITS/spectrum_????.FITS a set of FITS files taken with one of the SALSA antennas at Onsala Space Observatory.
* salsa.R - an R script to read the FITS files and display them
* salsa.py - the same in Python
* Salsa.ipynb - the same as an IPython Notebook
